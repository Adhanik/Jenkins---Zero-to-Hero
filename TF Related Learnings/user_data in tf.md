# How user_data works in TF?

Terraform can automate the installation of Jenkins on an EC2 instance as part of the instance creation process. This can be achieved by using the `user_data` attribute in the `aws_instance` resource. The `user_data` attribute allows you to specify a script that will run on the instance at boot time. This script can include commands to install Jenkins and perform any other necessary setup.

### Example of Terraform Configuration to Install Jenkins:

Here's an example of how you might configure Terraform to install Jenkins on an EC2 instance:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "ec2" {
  ami           = var.ami
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = "mykeypair"

  user_data = <<-EOF
              #!/bin/bash
              # Update package lists
              sudo yum update -y

              # Install Java (required for Jenkins)
              sudo yum install -y java-1.8.0-openjdk

              # Add Jenkins repository and import the GPG key
              wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
              rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key

              # Install Jenkins
              sudo yum install -y jenkins

              # Start Jenkins service
              sudo systemctl start jenkins
              sudo systemctl enable jenkins
              EOF

  tags = {
    Name = "Jenkins"
  }
}
```

### How It Works:

1. **`user_data`**: The `user_data` attribute contains a shell script that will run when the EC2 instance starts.
2. **Script Details**:
   - **Update**: Updates the package list on the instance.
   - **Install Java**: Installs Java, which is required for Jenkins.
   - **Add Jenkins Repo**: Adds the Jenkins repository to the instance.
   - **Install Jenkins**: Installs Jenkins from the repository.
   - **Start Jenkins**: Starts the Jenkins service and enables it to start on boot.

### Applying the Configuration

Once you've added the `user_data` to your Terraform configuration, apply the changes:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Terraform will create the EC2 instance and, during the instance's initial boot process, it will automatically install Jenkins using the script provided in `user_data`.

This approach ensures that every time you create an EC2 instance with this Terraform configuration, Jenkins will be installed and started automatically.
