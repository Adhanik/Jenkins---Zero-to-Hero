# 1. What would happen if you dont pass key_pair in your main.tf while creating EC2 Instance?

#  Ans - If we dont pass the pem key, then we would not be able to login to the EC2 instance created.

# 2. We faced this error 

    ssh ec2-user@private ip -i mykeypair.pem - does not works

    sh ec2-user@public ip -i mykeypair.pem - this works

Why?

# Sol
The difference between using the private IP and the public IP when attempting to SSH into an EC2 instance depends on how your network is set up and whether the machine you are using to SSH has access to the private IP address of the instance.

### Why SSH to the Private IP Doesn't Work

- **Private IP Address**: The private IP address of an EC2 instance is only accessible within the same VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) or through a VPN/Direct Connect setup that bridges your local network with the VPC. If you are trying to SSH into the instance using the private IP address from your local machine (outside AWS), the connection will fail because your machine cannot route to that private IP over the internet.

- **Public IP Address**: The public IP is accessible over the internet. When you SSH using the public IP address, you're connecting through the internet to your EC2 instance, which is why this works without issue.

### Common Scenarios

1. **Local Machine Outside AWS Network**:
   - **Private IP**: Inaccessible unless you are connected to the VPC through a VPN or other secure tunnel.
   - **Public IP**: Accessible because it routes over the internet.

2. **Local Machine Inside the Same VPC (e.g., Another EC2 Instance)**:
   - **Private IP**: Accessible because it's within the same network.
   - **Public IP**: Also accessible, but usually not necessary to use.

### Solutions if You Need to Use the Private IP

- **Use a Bastion Host**: 
  - Set up a bastion host (jump box) in a public subnet. SSH into the bastion host using the public IP, then SSH from the bastion host into the private IP of the target EC2 instance.
  
  ```bash
  ssh -i mykeypair.pem ec2-user@public-ip-of-bastion
  ssh -i mykeypair.pem ec2-user@private-ip-of-target-instance
  ```

- **Set Up a VPN**:
  - Create a VPN connection to your VPC. This will allow your local machine to access the private IP addresses within the VPC.

- **Use AWS Systems Manager (SSM)**:
  - If the instance has the SSM agent installed and is properly configured, you can use AWS SSM to connect to your instance without needing direct SSH access.

By default, using the public IP for SSH is the simplest and most common approach unless you have specific network configurations that allow or require the use of private IP addresses.
